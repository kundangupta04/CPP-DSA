# Time Space Complexity and Big O Notation

## Asymptotic analysis
> No. of operation w.r.t change in input.
>> Growth :- const < logN < rootN < n < nLogN < n^2 < n^3 < 2^n
{ less growth = fast algorithm }

## Types of Time complexity
>> Worst Case Time Complexity --> Big O(n)
>> Best Case Time Complexity --> Big Omega(1)
>> Average Case Time Complexity --> Big Theta(n)


# Space Complexity
> It is the extra memory space requirement of an algorithm, using asymptotic analysis.
