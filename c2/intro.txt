// c++ Opeators


--> Arithmetic Opeators (Addition +, subtraction -, miltiplication *, Division /, Modulus<reminder> %, Increment ++, Decrement --)

--> Relational Opeators (Is Equals to ==, Not Equals to !, Greater Than >, Less Than <, Greater than or equals to >=, lesser than or equals to <=) : gives output in true / false.

--> Logical Opeators (Logical And &&, Logical Or ||, Logical not !) : comapre in true / false

--> Assignment Opeators (=, +=, -=, /=, %=)

--> Bitwise Opeators (Bitwise Complement ~, Left Shift <<, Right Shift, Bitwise OR |, Bitwise AND &, Bitwise exclusive OR ^)

--> Misc Opeators (SizeofOperator, Condition?Expression1:Expression2, Comma Operator, Dot and arrow Operator, Casting Operator, & Address Operator, * Pointer Opeator )

--> Unary Operators (+ Unary plus, - Unary minus, ++ Increment Operator, -- Decrement Operator, ! Logical Complement Opeator)
